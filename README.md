# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis 
* The purpose of this project was to perform an exploratory analysis on rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride sharing services for underserved neigbhorhoods. 
* By using the 2 sets of data, I was able to compare the amount of rides and the fares in three types of cities: urban, suburban, and rural. 
* Through the use of Matplotlib I was able to desmonstrate the relationship between the total fares by city types through time.

## Results 
* I merged the two datasets and created a dataframe that displayed the information below for each city type:

 total rides - there are more of the total rides in the urban city compraing to the suburban and rural cities. This is self-explanatory since there are more people in the urban city. 
 total drivers  - there are also more drivers in urban comparing to the other two. Since there are more people living in the urban area, there is more movement and jobs. 
 total fares - the total fares also align with the other two, the total amount of money is higher in the urban areas becasue there are more rides. 
 average fare per ride and driver - with the are
 total fare by city type
