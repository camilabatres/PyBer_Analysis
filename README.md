# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis 
* The purpose of this project was to perform an exploratory analysis on rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride sharing services for underserved neigbhorhoods. 
* By using the 2 sets of data, I was able to compare the amount of rides and the fares in three types of cities: urban, suburban, and rural. 
* Through the use of Matplotlib I was able to desmonstrate the relationship between the total fares by city types through time.

## Results 
* I merged the two datasets and created a dataframe that displayed the information below for each city type:

 total rides - there are more of the total rides in the urban city compraing to the suburban and rural cities. This is self-explanatory since there are more people in the urban city. 
 total drivers  - there are also more drivers in urban comparing to the other two. Since there are more people living in the urban area, there is more movement and jobs. 
 total fares - the total fares also align with the other two, the total amount of money is higher in the urban areas becasue there are more rides. 
 average fare per ride and driver - The average fare per ride in the rural city was hgiher than the urban and suburban. This means that the fare per ride is higher is rural areas than the other two cities. This might be because there are larger distances in rural areas. 
 average fare by city type - the fares per driver is higher in rural areas than urban and suburban areas. this is because there are way more drivers in the urban area making the fare share smaller. 
 Below is a graph that displays the total fare data by city type to understand the trends through time.

 ## Summary 
* I recommend the following to address any disparity among the city types
* Measure the distance of the rides in order to have a better insight of each city. Probably in rural and suburban areas, the distances are longer than the ones in the city. 
* In order to improve the access to ride sharing services in underserved neighborhoods, there has to be an increase of drivers in those areas but that might have its challenges because there is smaller population in the rural and suburban areas. 
* A final recommnedation is to look what is happening in April in the rural city in order to address the disparity.
